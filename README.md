# Todo-list
A simple todo. Branch "linted" linted with airbnb and stores card info as objects

Clone down the repo, and navigate in to the folder.
In the terminal write "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080" to serve
the app on http://localhost:8080/

This app lets you create a list of todo cards that can be saved,
and retrieved later. They can be marked as done to enable the option
to remove them from the list. 

Added simple deadline functionality which color codes the card.
